# Creating Nested Classes

A _nested class_ is a class that is defined within another class. 
A _nested class_ that is not static is called an _inner class_. 

There are four of types of nested classes:

* A member inner class is a class defined at the same level as instance variables. It is not static. Often, this is just referred to as an inner class without explicitly saying the type.
* A local inner class is defined within a method.
* An anonymous inner class is a special case of a local inner class that does not have a name.
* A static nested class is a `static` class that is defined at the same level as static variables.

### Member Inner Classes
A _member inner class_ is defined at the member level of a class (the same level as the methods, instance variables, and constructors).

* Can be declared public, private, or protected or use default access Can extend any class and implement interfaces
* Can be abstract or final
* Cannot declare static fields or methods
* Can access members of the outer class including private members

```java
public class Outer {
    private String greeting = "Hi";
    protected class Inner {
        public int repeat = 3;
        public void go() {
            for (int i = 0; i < repeat; i++)
            System.out.println(greeting); 
        }
    }
    
    public void callInner() { 
        Inner inner = new Inner(); 
        inner.go();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        //outer.callInner(); 
        Inner inner = outer.new Inner(); // create the inner class
        nner.go();
    } 
}
```
_Inner classes_ can have the same variable names as outer classes.
```
System.out.println(x); 
System.out.println(this.x);
System.out.println(B.this.x); 
System.out.println(A.this.x);
```
#### Private interfaces

```java
public class CaseOfThePrivateInterface { 
    private interface Secret {
        public void shh(); 
    }
    class DontTell implements Secret { 
        public void shh() { }
    }
}
```
* The interface itself does not have to be public, though.
* Just like any inner class, an inner interface can be private

### Local Inner Classes
A local inner class is a nested class defined within a method. 

 Local inner classes have the following properties:
 
 * They do not have an access specifier.
 * They cannot be declared _static_ and cannot declare _static_ fields or methods.
 * They have access to all fields and methods of the enclosing class.
 * They do not have access to local variables of a method unless those variables are `final` or effectively `final`. 

 - If the code could still compile with the keyword final inserted before the local variable, the variable is effectively final.

```java
 public class Outer {
     private int length = 5; 
     public void calculate() {
         final int width = 20; 
         class Inner {
             public void multiply() { 
                 System.out.println(length * width);
            } 
         }
         Inner inner = new Inner();
         inner.multiply(); 
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Outer outer = new Outer(); 
        outer.calculate();
    } 
}
```
### Anonymous Inner Classes
An _anonymous inner class_ is a local inner class that does not have a name.
It is declared and instantiated all in one statement using the `new` keyword.

The _anonymous inner class_ is the same whether you implement an `interface` or `extend` a class!

```java

public class AnonInner { 
    interface SaleTodayOnly {
        int dollarsOff(); 
    }
    
    public int admission(int basePrice) { 
        SaleTodayOnly sale = new SaleTodayOnly() {
            public int dollarsOff() { return 3; } 
        };
        return basePrice - sale.dollarsOff();
    }
}
```

### Static Nested Classes

A _static nested class_ is a static class defined at the member level.

It can be instantiated without an object of the enclosing class, so it canâ€™t access the instance variables without an explicit object of the enclosing class.

In other words, it is like a regular class except for the following:
* The nesting creates a namespace because the enclosing class name must be used to refer to it.

* It can be made private or use one of the other access modifiers to encapsulate it. 

* The enclosing class can refer to the fields and methods of the static nested class.

```java
public class Enclosing { 
    static class Nested {
        private int price = 6; 
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
    Nested nested = new Nested(); 
    System.out.println(nested.price);
    } 
}
```
